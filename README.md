# Sorting-Agorithms-Visualizer
# Sorting Visualizer
#Check below for test cases

This is a personal project that aims to provide an interactive visualization of various sorting algorithms. The project allows users to generate a random array and observe the sorting process using different algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quicksort.

## Features

- Generate a random array of elements.
- Visualize the sorting process step-by-step for different algorithms.
- Adjust the animation speed for better understanding.
- Display algorithm notes to explain the sorting logic.
- Interactive UI with buttons to control the sorting process.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Click the "Generate Array" button to create a random array of elements.
4. Select the desired sorting algorithm by clicking the corresponding button (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, or Quicksort).
5. Observe the sorting process, and refer to the algorithm notes for a better understanding.
6. You can adjust the animation speed by modifying the `delayDuration` value in the code.
